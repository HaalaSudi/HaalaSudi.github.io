                             During our first year we were tasked in making a website independently. For this I used HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript to create a website for landscape enthusiasts. This website functioned like an article that the users could subscribe to. This website includes; a landscape architects page, a landscape art page, a landscape photography page and an about page.
