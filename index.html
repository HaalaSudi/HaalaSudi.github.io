                            pixelRun is an augmented reality app designed for runners, it is concept that was created as a group for our software projects module for University.
                            Augmented reality is a type of technology that expands on the physical world by adding layers that contains digital information. 
                            With this technology we could add sounds, videos and graphics to the existing environment. 
                            It would be designed so that runners would be able to see coins on a route during their break, collecting these coins would give them points, when collecting a predetermined amount, they would receive achievements trophies. 
                            This would not only keep the runners active during their break but also entertained!<a href="files/Final%20Report%20GH.pdf" download>Click here to download the final concept report</a>

With this website a user can add, update and delete recipes. These recipes will show on the lists page. This website has access control meaning that you need to log in before you can access any of the pages. You can register and log in, this will save your session util you logout.
